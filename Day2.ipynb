        "So far we have only considered a haploid bacterial genome, with a very small overall size. In such simple genomes an assembly graphs may suggest multiple paths through a given sequence due to repeating sequence, but we know that there is likely only one biologically real path through the graph. In diploid (and polyploid) organisms, this becomes more complicated because there are more than one real biological paths through the graph. These alternate paths are due to the presence of sister chromatids, that are not identical to each other, due to the presence of genetic variation, or heterozygosity. A key factor in assembling high quality genome assemblies, is the \"phasing\" of the chromosomes. It can be difficult to distinguish whether a given heterozygous region belongs to one chromosome copy or the other. Variation found along the same chromosome is in \"linkage\" or can be said to have the same \"phase\". A perfect genome assembly would reconstruct the variation from each chromosome perfectly as found in the original organism, however in practice this can be difficult to achieve. The figures below should help to explain this problem and the potential solutions.\n",

In this example, we generated long reads for an F1 individual and short Illumina reads for the parents. We were able to use the Illumina reads to separate the F1 PacBio reads into two groups for assembly.\n",
