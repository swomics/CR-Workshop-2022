## Introduction

Today we will be discussing and performing Genome assembly. Assembly refers to the translation of raw sequencing data into a representation of the source DNA genome. You will learn about the types of data and algorithms you can use to accomplish this, their advantages and disadvantages and how you might accomplish this. Since this is the first day of the workshop, we will also spend some time covering the Unix command line environment and how you can interact with it during this workshop.

1.  Logging on to the computing environment

2.  DNA sequence data: Platforms & Formats

3.  DNA sequence data: Pre-Assembly QC

4.  DNA sequence data: Assembly

5.  DNA sequence data: Post-Assembly QC

## 2. DNA sequence data: Platforms & Formats

DNA sequencing technology has been subject to many different fundamental technical advances. Broadly speaking, as of 2022, there are three dominant technologies for whole genome sequencing: Sequencing by synthesis (Illumina), Single molecule real-time (PacBio) and nanopore sensing (Oxfor Nanopore Technologies). The output of these different platforms differ by three key parameters 1) cost per base-pair 2) error-profile and 3) read-length. A recent review of genome assemblies for Lepidopteran genomes suggested that PacBio HiFi data is currently the best performing approach for assembly (cite gigascience kawahara lab). Below you can see an interactive plot of different datasets in the Sequence Read Archive (SRA), highlighting differences in read length produced by the different platforms.

A comparative overview of different DNA sequencing technologies (restricted to Order:Lepidoptera datasets)
