## Active learning time!

In the previous sessions, we've had some hands on time running different programs and hopefully gaining an idea of the types of information we can extract from genomic data. Today I would like you to split into groups and attempt to formulate an evolutionary hypothesis that could be investigated using genomic data and the methods we have covered.

You've learned how to use genomic data to estimate heterozygosity for an organism, how to look for endosymbiotic bacteria, how to find genes and organise them into orthologous groups and trees. You've also learned how to compare genomes at a chromosome level. Using the DToL Lepidoptera species, we can think about linking these types of data across multiple species to a [database of ecological traits](https://catalogue.ceh.ac.uk/documents/5b5a13b6-2304-47e3-9c9d-35237d1232c6). This database includes data on long and short term population size trends, host-plant specificity, phenological shifts and more!

You don't have to worry about completing the project rigorously, this is simply an opportunity to begin thinking about how genomic data can be applied to ask biological questions

Here are some example hypotheses you could think about:

-   Do long term population declines predict reduced levels of heterozygosity? ([paper](https://www.pure.ed.ac.uk/ws/portalfiles/portal/105263079/s41467_019_11308_4.pdf))

-   Do polyphagous species have greater numbers of duplicated genes? ([paper](https://bmcgenomics.biomedcentral.com/articles/10.1186/s12864-016-3096-1#Sec2))

-   Do species that pupate in shared environments share similar endosymbionts? ([paper](https://www.pnas.org/doi/10.1073/pnas.2115608119))

-   Do closely related species have similar genome size? ([paper](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC5552920/))

You will need to think about how you will gather the genomic and ecological data, and how your resulting graphs might look.
