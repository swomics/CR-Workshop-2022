You will learn about the types of data and algorithms you can use to accomplish this, their advantages and disadvantages and how you might accomplish this. Since this is the first day of the workshop, we will also spend some time covering the Unix command line environment and how you can interact with it during this workshop.\n\nLogging on to the computing environment\nDNA sequence data: Platforms & Formats\nDNA sequence data: Pre-Assembly QC\nDNA sequence data: Assembly\nDNA sequence data: Post-Assembly QC"

    "text": "2. DNA sequence data: Platforms & Formats\nDNA sequencing technology has been subject to many different fundamental technical advances. Broadly speaking, as of 2022, there are three dominant technologies for whole genome sequencing: Sequencing by synthesis (Illumina), Single molecule real-time (PacBio) and nanopore sensing (Oxfor Nanopore Technologies). The output of these different platforms differ by three key parameters 1) cost per base-pair 2) error-profile and 3) read-length. A recent review of genome assemblies for Lepidopteran genomes suggested that PacBio HiFi data is currently the best performing approach for assembly (cite gigascience kawahara lab). Below you can see an interactive plot of different datasets in the Sequence Read Archive (SRA), highlighting differences in read length produced by the different platforms.\nA comparative overview of different DNA sequencing technologies (restricted to Order:Lepidoptera datasets)"
