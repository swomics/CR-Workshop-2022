    "text": "2. DNA sequence data: Platforms & Formats\nAt it’s core whole genome sequencing is the repeated random sub-sampling of genomic sequence. The data properties of these sub-samples (called sequencing “reads”) depends on the technology used to generate them. DNA sequencing technology has been subject to many different fundamental technical advances. Broadly speaking, as of 2022, there are three dominant systems: Sequencing by synthesis (Illumina), Single molecule real-time (PacBio) and nanopore sensing (Oxford Nanopore Technologies). The output of these different platforms differ by three key parameters 1) cost per base-pair 2) error-profile and 3) read-length.\nBelow you can see an interactive plot of different data sets in the Sequence Read Archive (SRA), highlighting differences in read length produced by the different platforms. A recent review of genome assemblies for Lepidopteran (butterfly/moth) genomes suggested that PacBio HiFi data is currently the best performing approach for assembly (Ellis et al., 2021). We will come back to this in the assembly section below.\n\nFigure 1: A comparative overview of different DNA sequencing technologies (restricted to Order: Lepidoptera datasets)"

    "text": "3. DNA sequence data: Pre-Assembly QC\nThe type of sequencing and assembly you may want to do can depend on your study organism. Some species have intrinsically more or less complex genomes. The basis of this complexity is, well… complex! There are a few important considerations that can inform your strategy, but sometimes it is difficult to know what these may be without data. Some major considerations are; sequencing coverage, ploidy, heterozygosity, repeat density and repeat structure.\n\nSequencing coverage\nSequencing coverage is the number of times that any given base-pair in your genome appears in your sequencing read data. Put another way, it is the ratio of sequence read data to actual genome size, so if we imagine a 100Mbp haploid genome and we have 1Gbp of sequencing data, we would estimate that we have a sequencing coverage of 10. In practice, this estimate is usually roughly accurate for the median coverage value, but due to the random probability of sampling in combination with sequencing bias, coverage varies according to a distribution.\n\n\nPloidy\nPloidy refers to the number of chromosome copies that an organism has. A single copy is haploid, two copies of a chromosome is diploid (most sexually reproducing organisms are diploid), however higher numbers of copies (the general term is polyploid) are commonly found in nature, particularly in plants.\nIt is important to note that different ploidy states can exist within an organism - In humans for example, the autosomes are most often diploid, the mitochondrial genome is most often haploid, and the X chromosome can be either haploid or diploid, depending on which gametes fuse during fertilisation.\nIn addition, ploidy levels can vary between different tissues. Some cells found in the liver are normally polyploid and karyotype alterations have also been linked to cancerous tissues. In another case, Honey bees can have entirely haploid autosomes (which initiates male development) or diploid autosomes (which initiates female development) (Aamidor et al., 2018). Choosing which individual and tissue to sample for whole genome sequencing is a crucial decision!\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nRepeat density & Repeat structure\nOne useful initial QC procedure to follow is to break down sequencing reads into short (for instance 21bp) overlapping sub-strings called k-mers (in this case we would call them 21-mers) to allow us to get a more accurate assessment of genomic coverage. k-mers are useful because some sequencing reads contain errors (remember that some data types have more than others!). By breaking down reads into sub-strings, we ensure that even when there is an error present in the read, we can still get information from the surrounding error-free sequence."
